1. Does SMO do better than the random baselines (see prints 1,2,4)?
Ans. Random baselines are more efficient in terms of computing speed (if we are taking less than 10 rows), but it does not provide a more optimal solution than SMO.

2. How many y row evaluations are required for print 3?
Ans. We are evaluating every row and selecting the row with the best d2h value.

3. How does SMO do compared to absolute best (print 3)?
Ans. SMO is more efficient in terms of computing speed because it does not evaluate every row. However, the absolute best result produces the global optimum.
